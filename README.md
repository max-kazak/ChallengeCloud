ChallengeCloud
==============
###Idea
Most people are stuck in everyday usual routine. This app is supposed to encourage them to bring something new to their life. New sport activity, discovering one's creative side, new positive habit, or one more step to a healthier life. By offering simple challenges for limited time and tracking one’s progress on it application may help to change life in a good way.

It’s also good to make the challenging process more like a game where for any progress challenger makes he/she gets extra credits and then can compare results with his/her friends or other participants.
